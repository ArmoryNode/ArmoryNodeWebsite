My website üòÄ

## ü™ü Overview
This repository contains the source code for my website. It's currently very minimal, but I plan on adding more stuff to it. I ported this from standard HTML/CSS/JS mainly as a way to learn how to write Elm, in hopes to advance my knowledge of functional programming.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Used
[![Elm](https://img.shields.io/badge/Elm-60B5CC?style=for-the-badge&logo=elm&logoColor=white)](https://elm-lang.org/)
[![Deno](https://img.shields.io/badge/Deno-000000?style=for-the-badge&logo=deno&logoColor=white)](https://deno.com/)
[![TypeScript](https://img.shields.io/badge/TypeScript-007ACC?style=for-the-badge&logo=typescript&logoColor=white)](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
[![Sass](https://img.shields.io/badge/Sass-CC6699?style=for-the-badge&logo=sass&logoColor=white)](https://sass-lang.com/)

## üë∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Getting Started
Since this is my personal website, I don't really expect anyone to want to run it locally, but if you do, these are the steps you'll need to take.

### Prerequisites

- Elm (https://elm-lang.org/)
- Deno (https://deno.com/)
- Wrangler (https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/install-and-update/)

### Building
1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/armorynode/ArmoryNodeWebsite.git
cd ArmoryNodeWebsite
```

2. Build and run the project
```bash
# Use this command to build and run the project
wrangler pages dev

# Use this command if you only wish to generate the javascript and css
# (e.g. using your own web server)
deno task build
```

The website should now be running at `http://localhost:8787`

*Note: If the port is in use, change the `port` setting in `wrangler.toml` under `[dev]` to any other open port.*
