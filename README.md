My website üòÄ

## ü™ü Overview
This repository contains the source code for my website. It's currently very minimal, but I plan on adding more stuff to it. I ported this from standard HTML/CSS/JS mainly as a way to learn how to write Elm, in hopes to advance my knowledge of functional programming.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Used
[![Elm](https://img.shields.io/badge/Elm-60B5CC?style=for-the-badge&logo=elm&logoColor=white)](https://elm-lang.org/)

[![Sass](https://img.shields.io/badge/Sass-CC6699?style=for-the-badge&logo=sass&logoColor=white)](https://sass-lang.com/)<br>

## üë∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Getting Started
Since this is my personal website, I don't really expect anyone to want to run it locally, but if you do, these are the steps you'll need to take.

### Prerequisites

- Elm (https://elm-lang.org/)
- Deno (https://deno.com/)
- Node.js (https://nodejs.org/en) (This is only required until [this bug is fixed](https://github.com/denoland/deno/issues/26349))

### Building
1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/armorynode/ArmoryNodeWebsite.git
cd ArmoryNodeWebsite
```

2. Build and run the project
```bash
# Use this command to build and run the project
deno task run

# On first run it will ask you to install wrangler (if you don't already have it).
# Just hit enter to continue, this will only need to be done once.
Need to install the following packages:
wrangler@x.x.x
Ok to proceed? (y)
```

The website should now be running at `http://localhost:8787`

*Note: If the port is in use, change the `port` setting in `wrangler.toml` under `[dev]` to any other open port.*
